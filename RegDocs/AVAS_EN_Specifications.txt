6.  
Specifications 
6.1. 
General specifications 
For the purpose of this Regulation, the vehicle shall fulfil the following 
requirements: 
6.2. 
Acoustics characteristics 
The sound emitted by the vehicle type submitted for approval shall be measured 
by the methods described in Annex 3 to this Regulation. 
The specifications of this Regulation are applicable for the speed range of 
greater than 0 km/h up to and inclusive 20 km/h. Operation of an AVAS is 
permitted at vehicle speeds outside the specification range. AVAS may be 
operational independent of the operation of an internal combustion engine inside 
or outside of the specified operation range. 
If the vehicle that is not equipped with an AVAS fulfils the overall levels as 
specified in Table 2 below with a margin of +3 dB(A), the specification for 
one-third octave bands and the frequency shift do not apply.

6.2.1. 
Constant speed tests 
6.2.1.1. 
The test speeds for approval are 10 km/h and 20 km/h. 
6.2.1.2. 
When tested under the conditions of Annex 3 paragraph 3.3.2., the vehicle shall 
emit a sound: 
(a) 
That has a minimum overall sound pressure level for the applicable test 
speed according to Table 2 of paragraph 6.2.8.; 
(b) 
That has at least two of the one-third octave bands according to Table 2 
of paragraph 6.2.8. At least one of these bands shall be below or within 
the 1,600 Hz one-third octave band; 
(c) 
With minimum sound pressure levels in the chosen bands for the 
applicable test speed according to Table 2 of paragraph 6.2.8., column 3 
or column 4. 
6.2.1.3. 
If after a vehicle is tested in accordance with Annex 3 paragraph 3.3.2., for ten 
consecutive times within a series of measurements without recording a valid 
measurement because the vehicle's internal combustion engine (ICE) remains 
active or restarts and interferes with the measurements, the vehicle is exempted 
from this particular test. 
6.2.2. 
Reversing test 
6.2.2.1. 
When tested under the conditions of Annex 3 paragraph 3.3.3. the vehicle shall 
emit a sound that has a minimum overall sound pressure level according to 
Table 2 of paragraph 6.2.8., column 5. 
6.2.2.2. 
If after a vehicle is tested in accordance with Annex 3, paragraph 3.3.3., for ten 
consecutive times within a series of measurements without recording a valid 
measurement because the vehicle's ICE remains active or restarts and interferes 
with the measurements, the vehicle is exempted from this particular test. 
6.2.3. 
Frequency shift to signify acceleration and deceleration 
6.2.3.1. 
The intention of frequency shift is to acoustically inform road users about the 
change in vehicle speed. 
6.2.3.2. 
When tested under the conditions of Annex 3 paragraph 4, at least one tone 
within the frequency range as specified in paragraph 6.2.8. emitted by the 
vehicle shall vary proportionally with speed within each individual gear ratio 
by an average of at least 0.8 % per 1 km/h in the speed range from 5 km/h to 
20 km/h inclusive when driving in forward direction. In case more than one 
frequency is shifted, only one frequency shift needs to fulfil the requirements. 
6.2.4. 
Stationary sound 
 
The vehicle may emit a sound when stationary. 
6.2.5. 
Driver selectable sounds 
The vehicle manufacturer may define alternative sounds which can be selected 
by the driver; each of these sounds shall be in compliance and approved with 
the provisions in paragraphs 6.2.1. to 6.2.3. 
6.2.7. 
Pause function 
 
Any pause function as defined in paragraph 2.7. shall be prohibited.

6.2.8. 
Specifications on maximum sound level for AVAS 
When tested under the conditions of Annex 3 paragraph 3.3.2., a vehicle which 
is equipped with an AVAS, shall not emit an overall sound level of more than 
75 dB(A), if driving in forward direction.4 
(updated according to Supplement 1 to the 01 series of amendments – Date of 
entry into force: 11 January 2020) 
 
 
 
4  The maximum overall sound pressure level of 75 dB(A) measured at a distance of 2 m is 
corresponding to the overall sound pressure level of 66 dB(A) measured at a distance of 7.5 m. The 
limit value of 66 dB(A) at a distance of 7.5 m is the lowest permitted maximum value in Regulations 
established under the 1958 Agreement.

Modification and extension of approval of a 
vehicle type 
7.1. 
Every modification of the vehicle type shall be notified to the Type Approval 
Authority which approved the vehicle type. The Type Approval Authority may 
then either: 
7.1.1. 
consider that the modifications made are unlikely to have an appreciable 
adverse effect and that in any case the vehicle still complies with the 
requirements, or 
7.1.2. 
require a further test report from the Technical Service responsible for 
conducting the tests.
