4.1 General
4.1.1 Each vehicle shall be equipped with heating and ventilation systems for its manned space.
Conditioning systems are mandatory for vehicles of Category М3 and Class III, and driver's
workplaces (cabins) of vehicles of Category М3, Class I1), and recommended for other vehicles.
For modifications УХЛ and ХЛ of Categories N2, N3, M 2 and М3 and Classes II and III, vehicles are
additionally equipped with a redundant (emergency) heating system conforming to 4.2.9. This requirement is
optional for other vehicles.
4.1.2 Heating, ventilation and conditioning systems shall be supplied with devices controlling their
duty, air flowrate, direction of airflow from the outlets, and distribution of airflows over the driver's
workplace areas (head zone, feet zone and waist zone).
For vehicles of Categories М1 and N1 equipped with a climate control system, switching a
temperature control for the manned space to adjacent positions (if they are discrete) shall not lead to
temperature changes in the manned space in excess of 3 °C.
4.1.3 Control devices of ventilation, heating and conditioning systems shall be designed to disable
such systems completely when required. Individual components of these systems operating automatically
from the air flow associated with the vehicle movement (e.g., exhaust valves on the body) may still continue
functioning in this case.
4.1.4 If a conditioning system is installed, the vehicle need not be equipped with ventilation system
components that duplicate the functions of the conditioning system.
4.1.5 Devices intended to perform individual functions of heating, ventilation and conditioning
systems may be combined in a common unit or separate units, as selected by the design.

4.2 Requirements for heating system
4.2.1 The heating system shall either operate with an open air inflow, or support the selection of such
operation mode. The flowrate of open air through the heating system shall ensure that the requirements of
4.3.1 are met.
4.2.2 The duty of the heating system and the heat-protection efficiency of the body shall be sufficient
to maintain the thermal conditions in the manned space that are specified in Table 1 for different vehicle
modifications.
4.2.3 The thermal conditions of Table 1 shall be ensured at an ambient temperature of minus 25 °C
(for vehicle modification У) or minus 50 °C (for vehicle modifications УХЛ and ХЛ), and shall be achieved
at an air velocity (mobility) not exceeding 0.6 m/s in the head and waist zones of the driver (crew) and
passengers. The air velocity (mobility) in these zones may increase to 1 m/s during the first 10 min (for
vehicle modification У) or 15 min (for vehicle modifications УХЛ and ХЛ) after the start of driving.
The air temperature in the driver's feet zone in steady-state driving conditions shall be by (3 – 10) °C
higher than the one in the driver's head zone.
4.2.4 The heating system and the vehicle body shall be designed to avoid any ingress of non-
controlled open air flows into the manned space, for example, through the body seals (of windows, doors or
hatches), service holes, or interfaces between the structural members.
For vehicles of Category М3 and Class I, non-tightness in the adjoining areas of the hinges or
top/bottom edges of passenger doors and the body or floor (footboard) is permitted upon the condition that
the open air flows penetrating due to such non-tightness do not reach the breathing zone of the passengers
occupying the seats behind the respective doors.

 The temperature drop to 18 °C (for vehicle modification У) or 15 °C (for vehicle modifications УХЛ and ХЛ)
is permitted on seats located immediately behind the entrance door.
5)
 The spread of steady-state temperatures in the reference zones (feet, waist and head zones of passengers (crew
members)) within the compartment shall not exceed 5 °C not taking into account the temperature rise in local areas
adjacent to external surfaces of heaters and their air pipes, and in areas where the heated air flow is immediately
directed to.
4.2.5 The temperature of those heating system parts that may possibly be touched by the driver
(crew) or the passengers in the normal driving conditions shall rise above 70 °C for metallic surfaces or
80 °C for surfaces made of other materials or provided with a non-metallic coating.

system are separated from each other) are deemed to be compliant with the requirements of 4.2.5 and 4.2.6.
4.2.8 When the heating system is switched off, the heating temperature of any component or any
surface section inside the manned space shall not rise above 30 °C due to residual effects of the coolant, or
due to heat releases of the engine or other vehicle assemblies and systems.
4.2.9 Any redundant (emergency) heating system of the vehicle shall be either separated from the
engine cooling system, or shall enable disconnection from it.
The redundant (emergency) heating system shall be designed to maintain air temperatures not less
than 18 °C in the areas of the driver's workplace and the berth (if any) for 8 h at an ambient temperature of
minus 50 °C without the need for recharging the batteries or for refuelling.
4.3 Requirements for ventilation system
4.3.1 A system of forced ventilation, operating either separately or in part of heating systems
conforming to 4.2.1, and a conditioning system conforming to 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 shall provide the following
inflow of free (open) air to the manned space:
- not less than 30 m3 /h per each person for vehicles of Categories M and N with up to and including
five seats (with the driver's workplace among them), and 7 m3/h per each next passenger in addition;
- not less than 120 m3/h supplied to the driver's workplace (taking into account the flowrate for blow-
off of the glazing if required by the design) and not less than 7 m3/h per each person for vehicles of
Categories М2 and М3 (Classes II and III);
- not less than 180 m 3/h supplied to the driver's workplace (taking into account the flowrate for off of

the total solar intensity is 1000 W/m2.
4.3.3 The ventilation system shall be suitable for maintaining the air velocity (mobility) in the head
and waist zones of the driver (screw) and passengers within the range of (0.5 – 1.5) m/s.
4.3.4 If the ambient temperature is above 17 °C, the air supplied (pumped) to the cabin and the
manned space shall not be heated by more than 3 °C as compared to the ambient temperature.

ГОСТ 30593-2015
4.4 Requirements for conditioning system (if available)
4.4.1 The conditioning system shall either operate with an open air inflow, or support the selection of
such operation mode. The flowrate of open air through the conditioning system shall ensure that the
requirements of 4.3.1 are met.
4.4.2 The conditioning system shall provide the means for controlling generation and direction of air
flows. The overall switch-on/switch-off of the conditioning system is done from the driver's workplace.
Outlets of each conditioning system for passenger compartments shall be designed to supply the
cooled air into areas that are free of passengers (crew) in normal operating conditions (upper zone of the
compartment, passages, sites at the doors, etc.). For vehicle Categories М1, N, М2 and М3, Classes A, I and
II, and for specialized vehicles, this requirement is considered satisfied if the outlets are equipped with
devices (headers, shutters, blinds, or similar) capable of changing the direction and intensity of air flows
from at least one passenger place.
Vehicles of Categories М2 and М3 and Classes B and III, shall be designed to provide an additional
supply of the cooled air through individual channels to each passenger place, with possible control of the air
flow intensity and direction, and with complete disabling the air flow if necessary.
Providing individual channels is not required if the automatic control of the conditioning system
ensures that the specified temperature is maintained, and the spread of steady-state air temperatures along the
length of the passenger compartment is at most 3 °C at the passenger and crew seats. Upon that, the cooled
air flow shall not be directed immediately to human breathing zones.
4.4.3 The conditioning system shall ensure that the air temperature in head zones of the driver
(crew) and passengers in the manned space will decrease within 10 min for vehicles of Categories М1 and N
or 20 min for vehicles of Categories М 2 and М3 after the conditioner start-up time (immediately after the
engine start-up) from an initial temperature at least 1.5 times greater than the ambient one to a temperature at
most 3 °C higher than the ambient temperature, if the ambient temperature is (30 ± 3) °C and the total solar
intensity is 1000 W/m2.
The above temperatures shall be achieved at an air velocity (mobility) not exceeding 0.3 m/s in head
zones of the driver (passengers). The air velocity (mobility) in these zones may increase to 0.5 m/s within the
first 5 min for vehicles of Categories М1 and N or 10 min for vehicles of Categories М2 and М3 after the
conditioning system is started.
4.4.4 The conditioning system shall not decrease the relative humidity in the manned space below
30 % in steady-state driving conditions.
4.4.5 The temperature of those conditioning system parts (excluding the outlets for the cooled air)
that may possibly be touched by the driver (crew) or the passengers in normal driving conditions shall not
decrease below 15 °C.
4.4.6 The air temperature at the output of the conditioning system shall not be less than 0 °C.
4.4.7 A coolant used in the conditioning system shall not belong to substances depleting the ozone
layer, in accordance with [3].
4.4.8 Vehicles equipped with a conditioning system that meets the requirements 4.4 are deemed
conforming to clauses 4.3.2-4.3.4 of this Standard.
