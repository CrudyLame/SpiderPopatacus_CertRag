3 Technical requirements 
 
3.1 Windscreen wiper system 
 
3.1.1 Each vehicle shall be equipped with at least one automatic windscreen wiper system. 
3.1.2 The area of the wiping zone shall not be less than 80 % of zone B and not less than 98 % of zone 
A where the size and dimensions of the latter zones are defined in accordance with Appendix 18 of [2]. 
3.1.3 The windscreen wiping zone shall meet the minimum requirements of 3.1.2 when the wiper is 
tested at the movement rates conforming to 3.1.4.2 in the conditions described in 4.1.11. 
3.1.4 The wiper mechanism shall support at least two operating movement rates. 
3.1.4.1 The first rate: not less than 10 and not greater than 55 wiping cycles per minute. 
3.1.4.2 The second rate: not less than 45 wiping cycles per minute. 
3.1.5 The difference between the highest rate and one of the slowest rates shall be at least 15 wiping 
cycles per minute. 
3.1.6 The rates specified in 3.1.4 should be checked in the conditions described in 4.1.1—4.1.6 and 
4.1.8. 
3.1.7 The intermittent duty of the system may be used to meet the requirements of 3.1.4 upon the 
condition that one of the rates conforms to 3.1.4.1 and the other one obtained by interruption of the main rate is 
at least 10 wiping cycles per minute. 
3.1.8 After the windscreen wiper system is switched off using its control, the wiper levers and blades 
shall automatically return to the stopped (parking) position. 
3.1.9 The system shall withstand its forced blocking for 15 s. The use of automatic safety devices is 
permitted providing that the recovery of normal operation will not require activation of any controls other than 
the wiper control. The test conditions and test method are described in 5.1.7. 
3.1.10 Aerodynamic effects due to the windscreen size and dimensions possibly affecting the system 
performance should be evaluated in the following conditions. 
3.1.10.1 Under air flows moving at a speed equal to 80 % of the maximum vehicle speed or to 
160 km/h, whichever is less, and the maximum wiper blade speed, the system shall wipe zone A as required in 
3.1.2 with no performance degradation. Prior to testing, zone A of the windscreen is subject to treatment in 
accordance with 4.1.8 and 4.1.9. During the tests, the cleaning edge of the wiper blade(s) shall remain in 
contact with the windscreen. Full separation of the cleaning edge from the windscreen surface is prohibited. 
The cleaning edge of the wiper blade(s) shall remain in contact with the windscreen within the limits of zone A 
dimensions specified in 3.1.2 for each full wiping cycle. Any partial separation of the cleaning edge during 
either direct or reverse movements of the wiper blade is not permitted. 
3.1.11 If the lead or the cleaning edge(s) of the wiper blade(s) are outside zone B indicated in 3.1.2 in 
the stopped (parking) position, manual withdrawal of the blade aside from the windscreen surface shall be 
possible to enable manual wiping of the surface.

3.1.12 The windscreen wiper system shall work without any decrease of its operating rate for 2 min 
when the windscreen is dry and the ambient air temperature is minus (18 + 3) °C. The respective test conditions 
are specified in 4.1.13. 
 
3.2 Windscreen washer system 
 
3.2.1 Each vehicle shall be equipped with a windscreen washer system with its working state linked to 
activation of the master switch on the vehicle. The system shall withstand the conditions where the nozzles are 
blocked and where it operates as described in 4.2.1.2—4.2.1.5. 
3.2.2 The performance of the system shall not degrade under exposure to temperature cycles specified 
in 4.2.3 and 4.2.4. 
3.2.3 The windscreen washer system shall ensure that liquid is sprayed over the stated windscreen 
regions without any traces of leaks, pipe disconnections or malfunctions in normal operating conditions at 
ambient air temperatures from minus (18 ± 3) °C to 80 °C. In addition, no traces of leaks or disconnections of 
any pipes shall be observed in the system when the nozzles are blocked. 
3.2.4 The system shall supply liquid in quantities sufficient for wiping 60 % of zone A indicated in 
3.1.2 in the conditions described in 4.2.5. 
3.2.5 The windscreen washer system shall switch on after manual activation of its control. Besides 
this, switching on and off of the system may be synchronised with any other system of the vehicle. 
3.2.6 The capacity of the tank for washing liquid shall not be less than 1 l.
