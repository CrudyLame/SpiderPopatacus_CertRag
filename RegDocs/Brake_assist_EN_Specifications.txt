In particular, the BAS shall be so designed, constructed and fitted as to be 
able to resist the corroding and ageing phenomena to which it is exposed. 
5.4.

Functional requirements 
6.1. 
General performance characteristics for category "A" BAS systems

allowed, provided they demonstrate at least an equivalent level of precision.

7.4.3. 
For the tests the reference time, t0, is defined as the moment when the brake 
pedal force reaches 20 N. 
 
Note: For vehicles equipped with a brake system assisted by an energy 
source, the applied pedal force necessary depends on the energy level that 
exists in the energy storage device. Therefore, sufficient energy level shall be 
ensured at the beginning of the test. 
 
 8. 
 
Assessment of the presence of a category "A" BAS  
 
A category "A" BAS shall meet the test requirements contained in 
paragraphs 8.1. and 8.2. 
8.1. 
Test 1: Reference test to determine FABS and aABS. 
8.1.1. 
The reference values FABS and aABS shall be determined in accordance with 
the procedure described in Annex 3 to this Regulation. 
8.2. 
Test 2: For activation of BAS 
8.2.1. 
Once an emergency braking condition has been detected, systems sensitive to 
pedal force shall show a significant increase in the ratio of: 
(a) 
Brake line pressure to brake pedal force, where permitted by 
paragraph 8.2.5.; or  
(b) 
Vehicle deceleration to brake pedal force. 
8.2.2. 
The performance requirements for a category "A" BAS are met if a specific 
brake application characteristic can be defined that exhibits a decrease of 
between 40 per cent and 80 per cent in required brake pedal force for (FABS -
 FT) compared to (FABS extrapolated - FT). 
8.2.3. 
FT and aT are threshold force and threshold deceleration as shown in Figure 1. 
The values of FT and aT shall be supplied to the Technical Service at the time 
of submission of the type-approval application. The value of aT shall be 
between 3.5 m/s² and 5.0 m/s².

Figure 1a 
Pedal force characteristic needed in order to achieve maximum deceleration with 
category "A" BAS 
 
8.2.4. 
A straight line is drawn from the origin through the point FT, aT (as shown in 
Figure 1a). The value of brake pedal force "F", at the point of intersection 
between this line and a horizontal line defined by a=aABS, is defined  
as FABS, extrapolated: 
 
8.2.5. 
As an alternative, which can be selected by the manufacturer, in the case of 
vehicles of category N1, or M1 derived from those N1 vehicles, with a gross 
vehicle mass GVM > 2,500 kg, the pedal force figures for FT, FABS,min, 
FABS,max and FAB,extrapolated may be derived from the brake line pressure 
response characteristic instead of the vehicle deceleration characteristic. This 
shall be measured as the brake pedal force is increasing. 
8.2.5.1. 
The pressure, at which ABS cycling commences, shall be determined by 
making five tests from 100 ± 2 km/h in which the brake pedal is applied up to 
the level which produces ABS operation and the five pressures at which this 
occurs as determined from front wheel pressure records, shall be recorded 
and the mean value obtained as PABS. 
8.2.5.2. 
The threshold pressure PT shall be stated by the manufacturer and correspond 
to a deceleration in the range of 2.5 - 4.5 m/s2. 
8.2.5.3. 
Figure 1b shall be constructed in the manner set out in paragraph 8.2.4., but

A category "B" BAS shall meet the test requirements contained within 
paragraphs 9.1. and 9.2. of this section.

After t = t0 + 0.8 s and until the vehicle has slowed down to a speed of 
15 km/h, the brake pedal force shall be maintained in a corridor between 
FABS, upper and FABS, lower, where FABS, upper is 0.7 FABS and FABS, lower is 0.5 FABS. 
 
The requirements are also considered to be met if, after t = t0 + 0.8 s, the pedal 
force falls below FABS, lower provided the requirement of paragraph 9.3. is 
fulfilled. 
9.3. 
Data evaluation 
 
The presence of BAS 'B' is demonstrated if a mean deceleration (aBAS) of at 
least 0.85 ∙ aABS is maintained from the time when t = t0 + 0.8 s to the time 
when the vehicle speed has been reduced to 15 km/h.
